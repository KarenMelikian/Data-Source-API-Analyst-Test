# Data-Source-API-Analyst-Test

## Client Requirements
- **Search Repositories**: The client needs to search public repositories on GitHub based on specific filters like programming language, number of stars, etc.
- **Get Commits**: The client wants to retrieve commit histories from repositories, including commit messages, authors, and commit dates.
- **Get Contents**: The client needs the ability to fetch specific content from repositories, such as README files or source code files.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md`: Documentation of the approach and reflection on the assignment.
- `/Content`: Contains files related to the API documentation, Python code for authentication, data extraction, handling errors, rate limits, and pagination.
- `/Postman_Collection`: Contains Postman collections or Jupyter notebooks used for testing the API.

## Approach
The assignment will cover the use of GitHub's REST API to fetch data like repositories, commits, and contents. We'll focus on authentication, data extraction, error handling, and working with pagination and rate limits.

## Reflection
This section will be added after completing the assignment. It will contain a reflection on the work done and any challenges faced.
